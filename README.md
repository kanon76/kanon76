👋 Hi, I’m @kanon76, a Computational & Systems Biology student at UCLA 

👀 I took courses CS 31 and CS 32 at UCLA

✨ I know how to code in Java and C++

💞️ The course CS 32's workload was a full-time job (no exaggeration) but it got me addicted to coding....

🌼 The code I have stored in my Github are all from CS 32

💻 The below are some of the skills I've gained through CS 32:
- Write the code to program a game ... check out Project 3 for my code for the game of Battle-ship! 🎮💛
- Exhibit ability to write and debug complex programs using data structures and object-oriented programming techniques
- Understand how to decompose large problems to design and structure solutions
- Understand object-oriented concepts (inheritance, polymorphism) and generic programming (templates)
- Understand the structure and performance characteristics of data containers (stacks, queues, lists, trees, hash tables)
- Understand the concept of algorithmic complexity (big-O)
- Use a software development environment for editing, compiling, and debugging programs
- Communicate program design through both external documentation and comments in code
